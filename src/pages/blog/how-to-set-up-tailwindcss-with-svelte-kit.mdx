Svelte kit and the new Tailwindcss just-in-time compiler just got released. Here's a super quick rundown on how to set them up (updated for tailwind 2.1 on the 8/4/2021):

> Remember: Svelte config files need to use the `cjs` extension instead of `js`

### Step 1: Set up the project

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
npm init svelte@next
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer
```

### Step 2: postcss

Create a `postcss.config.cjs` file. Svelte 3 is bundled by Vite which comes with postcss support out of the box.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    autoprefixer: {},
    tailwindcss: {},
  },
}
```

### Step 3: tailwind config

Create a `tailwind.config.cjs` file to enable the just-in-time compiler and add the correct paths to be purged. You can also run `npx tailwind init`

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: ['./src/**/*.svelte'],
}
```

### Step 4: create and import the css file

Add these tags somewhere in your css so that postcss knows where to insert the tailwind styles. A good place to import these is the `$layout.svelte` file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And there you go. If you have any issues, you can [check out the finished example on github](https://github.com/jescowuester/svelte-kit-with-tailwind-jit-example) or shoot me a dm on Twitter.
