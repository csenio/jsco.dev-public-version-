Undo / Redo is an extremely common thing to implement if you build apps on the web. In this article I'll show you how you can build a flexible, production-ready undo/redo system without having to compromise your state management.
The final api is going to look like this:

```js
import undoable, { undoTracker } from "./undoable.js";
// `undoable` acts like a regular writeable store
const name = undoable("Tom")
// history get's tracked across stores
const address = undoable({street: "example street", number: 12})
...
// to undo
undoTracker.undo()
```

here's an example of how it could look in action

If you're just here for the code, you can get it from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jescowuester/246b453db80a6755f2d1ea8b15ba3b88).

## How Undo / Redo works

In basic terms, `undo` undoes your latest change. `Redo` reapplies it.
This means we need to keep a list of all the changes a user did, and a list of all the changes he's undone.
For example if the user clicks the "+" button in the example above he changes the count from 1 to 2. So we can save our "change" like this:

```just
{
  from: { count: 1 }
  to: { count: 2 }
}
```

If we want to undo we set our value back to the "from" value. If we want to redo we instead use the "to" value from the latest change.

This is all a bit abstract so I made a dirty little visualization of how it works:

Notice that all the changes, no matter what input they come from, are tracked in the same list. When a user presses undo, he wants the last change **he made** to be undone, no matter where he made it.

## How we can implement it

We have a rough understanding of how it works, let's go code it. Roughly our code is going to look like this:

```
// Tack all undos and redos
const undoStore = writable([])
const redoStore = writable([])

// Undoable is a custom store
function undoable(initialData) {
  const store = writable(initialData)

  function _set(newValue) {
    // track the change in our undoStore
    store.set(newValue)
  }

  function _update(updater) {
    // track the change in our undoStore
    store.set(newValue)
  }

  return {
    subscribe: store.subscribe,
    set: _set,
    update: _update,
  }
}

```

We need to track what the value looks like before and after the change. To do this we can use Svelte's "tick" function:

```
 // pass in the previous value
 function trackUndoState(previous) {
    tick().then(() => {
        // get(store) after tick to get the updated value
        undoStore.update(stack => ([
        { from: previous, to: get(store) },
       ...stack,
      ])),
    })
  }
```

Implementing undo is just a matter of updating the right stores now.

```
 function undo() {
    const [lastUpdate, ...restUpdates] = undoStack
    // update origin store
    lastUpdate.store.set(lastUpdate.from)
    // remove from undo store
    undoStore.set(restUpdates)
    // add to redo store
    redoStore.update((arr) => [lastUpdate, ...arr])
  }
```

## Debouncing

Right now if a user types in an input and wants to undo a word he has to undo it letter by letter. To prevent this, we can patch together updates that happen very frequently.
This is very similar to debouncing an input. Keep in mind that this behavior may not always be wanted, the number input above for example is probably better off not being debounced.
