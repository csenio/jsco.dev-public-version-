# Work with me

I'm a UI engineer. I Design and Develop websites- usually, I do both at the same time. This allows me to quickly prototype ideas, go straight from wireframe to website and create responsive variants on the fly.

## How to get in touch

The easiest way is to send an e-mail with your project details to [Jesco.Wuester@gmail.com](mailto:Jesco.Wuester@gmail.com). I'll usually respond within 48 hours.

## What you can expect

I am fast and meticulously. You can always expect

- **Mobile-first** - _~70% of traffic comes from mobile devices. Great mobile Ux and fast loading speeds will have a positive impact on conversion rates._
- **Clean code** - _Meticulously commented code, well-named variables and small components will allow your team to extend my work easily._
- **Anti-bug guarantee** - _Bugs happen. If they happen within one year after my contract ends, I'll fix them for free._
- **Great SEO** - _Rich search results, SMO, good semantics, small bundles & all the other technical foundations for SEO._

## What I don't do

- **Backend work** - _I can set up a backend as part of a larger project but I prefer sticking to frontend and design_
- **IE support** - _IE is shrinking quickly and will be dead by 2021. The work that goes into making your site work well on a 7-year-old browser is usually not worth the effort._
- **Legacy Tech** - _Angular, jQuery, Magento, etc. - If your website is exclusively built on either of those you're better off working with someone else_

## Tech stack

I work in **Javascript** or **Typescript** and usually use **React** with **Next.js** for websites. For more ambitious projects or when performance is crucial I use **Svelte**.
I can quickly integrate with any tech stack and have experience using all major state management and styling paradigms.
